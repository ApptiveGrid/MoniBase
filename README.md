OmniBase
========

Originally at squeaksource, now moved to github.

OmniBase is a Smalltalk efficient object repository. 

Based on BTrees and filesystem, it has full [ACID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID) features.

While this software is old and doesn't have elegant code, it works really well for many scenarios and has an impressive performance.

For a clean API using it, check: [Aggregate](https://github.com/sebastianconcept/Aggregate)

This is the Pharo Smalltalk port of David Gorisek's original work.
