OmniBase
========

Originally at squeaksource, now moved to github.

OmniBase is a Smalltalk efficient object repository. 

Based on BTrees and filesystem, it has full ACID features.

While this software is old and doesn't have elegant code, it works really well for many scenarios and has an impressive performance.

This is the Pharo Smalltalk port of David Gorisek's original work.
